# Begin With Bayes: Assessing a Probabilistic and Decision Theoretic Approach to Statistics and Machine Learning Instruction

The framing and depth of statistics and machine learning instruction
varies widely. These differences rightly depend on the specifics of the
field in which statistics and machine learning is applied, aligning
instruction and existing student understanding. However, in settings
where students don’t have a common application, statistics and machine
learning instruction and existing student understanding can be
misaligned. In this paper, we propose using probability and decision
theory as a general, unifying approach to statistics and machine
learning instruction. We evaluate the impact of this approach on
business school student understanding in an interdiscplinary setting.

## Project Environment

After cloning this repository, go to the project’s terminal in Positron
and run `uv run` to create the `/.venv` project library and install the
specified Python and library versions.
